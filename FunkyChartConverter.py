"""

    Hello and thanks for passing by.

    This is the source code for the converter used in FunkyChart, a Roblox script intended for the game Funky Friday.
    If you downloaded this and don't know what you're doing, download the one from the Releases tab on GitHub instead,
    where it is converted to a .exe for your pleasure.

    If you DO know what you're doing, I hope I made it easy to read for your eyes. I'm actually pretty shit with Python.
    I've worked on this for so many hours and I sometimes don't know half of what I type LOL.

    If you eventually decide to fork this or intend to modify the code for re-distribution,
    please please please please PLEASE credit me on your work. I would really appreciate that.

    A message to you regardless:
    Thanks for downloading and using my script, if you're here to just use it once or plan to use it many times.
    I have put many hours into this as well as my YouTube channel with showcases and such. I don't really care about the views that much,
    but the amount of attention that those videos created have blown my mind. Thank you.

    Anyways enough with the speech, I hope you have fun.

[VERSION 1.11]

-   Made major changes to chart converting again (all chart before 1.11 are again invalid lol)
-   Added a feature where you can now name the chart file when converting!
-   Added a waiting screen when converting (this is to make people not click too early when its converting).



[VERSION 1.1]

-   Made major changes to chart converting (all charts before 1.1 are now invalid, sorry :( )
-   Fixed a bug with file path directory erroring out
-   Cleaned up title (not really just added verison as a variable lol)

-------------------------------------------------

[VERSION 1.05]

-   Added update notifier for future updates.
-   _G.customChart.loadedAudioID does not use getcustomasset or getsynasset anymore, will be done in-game.


[VERSION 1.04]

-   Testing support for the Krnl executor

[VERSION 1.03]

-   Fixed an issue with file saving where the converted chart couldn't save correctly. Haha...

[VERSION 1.02]

-   Fixed an error where the colorama module was not found.
-   Made it so that the Tk window does not pop up everytime it asks for a file.
-   Fixed an error when you copy an audio file and place it in the same folder (SameFileError).

[VERSION 1.01 - DELAYED]

-   Delayed released due to Roblox's audio privacy update.
-   Rewritten the program, commenting Krnl references and online mode.
-   Other fixes

[VERSION 1.0 - INITIAL RELEASE]

-   Initial release
-   Rewrote some lines for the 4v4 update on FF before release.
-   Organization
